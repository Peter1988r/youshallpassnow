## 🎨 **Logo Updates Complete!**

I've successfully updated all pages to use your new logo design! Here's what I've done:

### ✅ **Changes Made:**

1. **✂️ Removed Text from Navigation:**
   - Removed "YouShallPass" text from all navigation bars
   - The text is now embedded in your logo image

2. **📏 Logo Size Updated:**
   - Logo is now 1.5x larger (48px effective size)
   - Uses CSS scaling for crisp display across all devices

3. **🔄 Updated All Pages:**
   - **Landing page** (`public/index.html`)
   - **Sign-in page** (`public/signin/index.html`) 
   - **Admin dashboard** (`public/admin/index.html`)
   - **Event detail page** (`public/admin/event-detail.html`)
   - **Company dashboard** (`public/dashboard/index.html`)
   - **Events page** (`public/events/index.html`)

4. **📝 Updated Footer Text:**
   - Changed "YouShallPass" to "You Shall Pass" in footers
   - Updated copyright text across all pages

### 🖼️ **Next Step - Replace Logo File:**

**You need to save your new logo image as:**
```
<code_block_to_apply_changes_from>
```

**Instructions:**
1. Save the new logo image (with "YOU SHALL PASS ACCREDITATION" and shield) 
2. Replace the existing file at `public/assets/images/logo.jpg`
3. The logo will automatically appear at 1.5x size on all pages

### 🚀 **Ready to Deploy:**

Once you replace the logo file, I can deploy the changes and your new branding will be live across the entire application!

The logo will now be:
- **✨ 1.5x larger** for better visibility
- **🎯 Standalone** without redundant text
- **🌐 Consistent** across all pages
- **📱 Responsive** and crisp on all devices

Would you like me to deploy these changes once you've replaced the logo file?
